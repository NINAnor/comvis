# Documentation of the COMVIS results

The results are presented in separate folder for each stage above:

- **Stage 1: Quality filter:** Can we use a simple algorithm based in image size to filter out low quality images?
- **Stage 2: MegaDetector detections:** How well do MegaDetector perform in identifying images without objects and images with one or more objects present?
- **Stage 3: custom Classifier:** Can we train a classifier based on identified animal objects from MegaDetector which identify the species of animal?
