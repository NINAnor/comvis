# Stage 3. Species-level annotation and identification 

MegaDetector detects animals on pictures and does not classify into taxa. In most applications however, the taxon of the animal is needed (e.g. indexes of species richness, species abundance or occurrence). We will develop the pipeline by using the animal detections of MegaDetector for training a custom species classifier.

## Set up a LabelStudio project for labeling

[LabelStudio] is an open source software for labelling all sort of data for training **machine learning algorithms**

When the detections have been cropped out it is necessary to label them to train a custom classifier model.

Export the labelstudio file as a `.csv` file

## Train the custom classifier

Once the crops have been properly labelled and that the labelstudio file have been exported it is possible to train the classifier model using `train_classifier.sh`.

The script takes 2 arguments: the path to the cropped pictures and the path to the exported labelstudio file. The script can be ran as follow:

```bash
./train_classifier.sh /PATHâˆ•TO/CROPS /PATH/TO/LABELSTUDIO/FILE
```

This will result in the creation of a `./log` folder containing information relative to the model training (i.e. the `events.out` files) and the model itself (i.e. the `.pt` file). Note that to visualize the `events.out` files you need to download and use `tensorboard`.

## Run the custom classifier on your own images
