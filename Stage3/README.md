# Stage 3. Species-level annotation and identification 

MegaDetector detects animals on pictures and does not classify into taxa. In most applications however, the taxon of the animal is needed (e.g. indexes of species richness, species abundance or occurrence). We will develop the pipeline by using the animal detections of MegaDetector for training a custom species classifier.
